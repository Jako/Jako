# Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas Jakobi ðŸ‘‹

I am a german **web-developer** & **designer** based in MÃ¼nsterland, Germany. I am the developer and/or maintainer of around 35 open source extras for MODX. I am the owner of [Treehill Studio](https://treehillstudio.com), an agency developing premium extras for MODX.

## Open Source

I love open source and I commit some of my spare time in open source projects. Most of these projects are extensions to [MODX](https://github.com/modxcms), a content management system to build fast, secure websites. 

If you like my work, you can sponsor me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Jako). You can also buy me a coffee (or two) on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/treehillstudio). I also offer paid coding of custom MODX extras.

## Current work

My last open source extra for MODX was [TwoFactorX](https://github.com/Jako/TwoFactorX), a MODX extra that adds a two-factor authentication to the MODX manager. Lately I released [Cursus](https://modmore.com/cursus/), a premium booking system for MODX on base of [Agenda](https://modmore.com/agenda/).
